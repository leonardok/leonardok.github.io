**DISCLAIMER #1:** I am no carpenter not shipwright.

**DISCLAIMER #2:** This post will be update with progress. For now its on draft mode.

Since I sold my 40ft sailboat I wanted to have something smaller, that could be trailable. There are several lakes, and not to mention the close coast line, that
I can take a small dinghy for a day sail. The option for building it myself also restricted the choice to something simple. I am no expert on woodworking, just
very interested and patient, so simplicity was key in the choice of the project.

The brought me to the Morbic 12 ([https://www.vivierboats.com/en/product/morbic-12/](https://www.vivierboats.com/en/product/morbic-12/)) - as 12 foot boat designed
by François Vivier, an open dinghy that has seen lots of build. I am building it in my balcony, so there is also that. You will see in the pics that there is nothing
fancy and my workshop is also in my balcony. That is part of the fun!


### Part 0 - All the pieces

So many delays on this. I sent the cut out plans to a CNC shop and got them ready-ish to go.
