My name is Leonardo and I'm a Computer Science Undergrad at [UFRGS](http://ufrgs.br).
I'm a Linux user since a long time now - unfortunately I don’t have the time to 
keep testing a lot of distros anymore.

It was after 2006 that, when I bought a Mac, I left Linux over the mac (for 
desktop, I must say. Still my preferred development operating system.) I still 
have some virtual machines with Slackware (wich is my favorite) and an 
ArchLinux, that I maintain alive.

Here is a little brief of what I have been doing so far:

- I currently work at [T&T](http://www.tet.com.br) (not AT&T) in a Ruby on Rails
awesome super secret project, but I've also worked with: Embedded operating 
systems and storage virtualization, in the HP Enterprise Virtual Arrays (a.k.a.
[EVA](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF02d/12169-304616-304648.html)), 
a storage solution with 5 9's; In HP SSTK for HP Integrity system.

- At Instaladora Elétrica Mercurio, I helped developing an ERP with PHP and 
MySQL, that runs the entrire company, taking care of (control) all (at least at
the time) resourses, time-tracking, stock... Pretty much everything.

- Then at [CWI Software](http://www.cwi.com.br/) as C developer, I have 
outsourced my working hours to Terra Networks, helping them to develop their 
support center. It was aimed at the internal support team, a management system 
for subscribers.

- At [Digistar](http://www.digistar.com.br), where I was intern of engineering, 
worked with C development, little stuffs in C++ and a lot of Linux. Awesome 
company, great people! 

And the beginning: as intern at [UNISINOS](http://www.unisinos.br), on something
that they call "cientific initiation". It's basically helping on research. You
do what the smart people say and learn a lot (at PIPCA (Programa Programa de Pós
Graduação em Computação Aplicada da Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos - 
UNISINOS/RS). I have worked with high performance computing there.

I have also tried to build my own company focusing in development with Ruby on 
Rails web applications. It didn't worked out because as I had to dedicate 
myself to university. Start-ups demand lots of time and you have to choose at
some point, but it was a very intense experience that I certainly don't regret.
